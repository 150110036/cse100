CSE 100 Homework
================

This is a simple repository to demonstrate GIT version control system for the CSE 100 class.

Your homework is to enter your IDs and names into the "NAMES.txt" file. You'll have to do the following to accomplish that:

 * Create a github account indicating your name. Your name should be recognizable on your profile.
 * Use any git client to "pull" files from this repository
 * Add your name and ID into the NAMES.txt file
 * "push" it back to the server.
 * You might need to learn details about pulling, merging, commiting and pushing - commands used to work with git - If you need any help, use Stackoverflow.com to get information.

Please consider the following:
------------------------------

 * Due date is 28.12.2012 23:59 PM. Commits/pushes after that date will not be considered.
 * Do not forget to push after commiting. You can find information on the Internet how to do it. Active learning is a part of this homework.
 * Do not delete each others' names. You might need to "merge" NAMEs.txt file. If you have a collusion.
 * If you delete another names of other class mates, you'll get no points.
 * Do not send any files via Email. Submission via email will not be accepted.
 * Good Luck and have fun!
